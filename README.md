# BIOS 777
This repository is in support of Steve Pittard's lecture for the BIOS 777 class.Trh structure of this repository is simple. There will be a presentation file (when I'm done with it). There are two sub folders that represent the two classes I currently teach: BIOS 545 and INFO 555. Look in these folders for the syllabus associated with each course
