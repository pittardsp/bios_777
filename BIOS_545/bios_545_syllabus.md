## Course Description:
This class is designed to provide an introduction to R and R programming. Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:

* Understand the concepts of the R programming language
* Write and debug R functions
* Create useful graphs
* Reshape and aggregate data
* Make adjustments to code to measure and improve performance
* Build R packages with proper documentation 

## Prerequisites - BIOS 501 or equivalent or permission of instructor
## Intended Audience:
This class is for students whose research requires non-trivial amounts of data manipulation and analysis. As with other domains such as Biology and Genetics, Public Health is experiencing a "Data Deluge" which is being addressed in large part by the application of innovative quantitative approaches that require a knowledge of R programming to implement. Therefore, we concentrate on developing programming skills as opposed to data analysis and/or statistical techniques although we do use examples from both these areas to illustrate important concepts. While this is an introductory class, any previous programming experience with other languages will be helpful. 

## Evaluation:

*Homework* (80%): Four homework sets each worth 20% of Final grade
*Final Exam* (20%): Students will be asked to write simple R programs and function during exam. Bring laptop computer with R installed at the final exam

## Learning Objectives

Upon completion of the PhD degree in Biostatistics the graduate will be able to:
* Use a variety of statistical computer packages
* Conduct appropriate statistical analyses
* Conduct complex statistical analyses for a broad range of applications

## Proposed Content:

Introduction 
R data types
R programing syntax
R graphics
Writing and debugging R functions
Reproducible Research Documents
R packages
Data Aggregation and Benchmarking
Basic Statistics and Simulations
The "tidy" verse
