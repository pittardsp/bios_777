# INFO 550 - Software Engineering
## Instructor: Steve Pittard

## Prerequisites:
Working knowledge of R, Python, Java or consent of Instructor. A willingness to rapidly learn new concepts to address specific problems is essential. 

## Brief Description:
This course seeks to teach principles of software engineering through hands-on experience in constructing a “real life” project. During this course, the student will be exposed to a variety of programming technologies, analysis frameworks, and reproducible research tools. We will examine the role of Cloud Computing service models, (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS), and how they can accelerate the pace of research. Students will acquire hands on exposure and experience with machine learning techniques such as clustering ad regression as well as natural language processing techniques. Students will use their acquired knowledge to develop a final project application that will address some substantial problem or interest emerging within ‘big data contexts”. 

## Objectives/Outcomes:
To achieve greater practical facility with software approaches to download, cleanse, and manipulate real world data using currently accepted best practices with the R and Python languages as well as cloud computing. This course will build upon the student's existing knowledge of analytics, statistics, and visualization to complete a programming project involving a non-trivial data source. Upon completion of this course the student will be able to:

1. Approach large-scale data sources and implement software methods (existing and authored) to efficiently download, cleanse, and analyze the information. 

2. Identify and intelligently discuss the bottlenecks associated with managing large scale data and computation projects and identify appropriate strategies for addressing such challenges

3. Implement actual programming examples that demonstrate an understanding of the topics being presented during the course.

Each week will involve the introduction of a topic designed to improve the student's ability to approach large and/or unwieldy data sources in terms of wrangling, analysis, and visualization. This information will be used to obtain, clean, and analyze a large data set along with the construction of a relevant model and accompanying visualization. The end result will be implemented inside of a reproducible research document (e.g. Sweave). Assignments will be submitted to the student's GitHub account
