## Teaching is Tough

> "I feel a large part of music education is a disaster today. A lot of it's coming from people who don't know how to teach"

> "There are still some great schools and sources of learning, and those people know exactly what I'm talking about" 

Jeff Berlin -  Considered by many to be the finest electric bass player in the world

He stresses the importance of fundamentals

## Beware of Micro Specialization 

- R for Business Intelligence
- Data Science for Epidemiologists
- Data Science for Nursing Research
- Intro to Statisics using R
- Data Visualization for Biologists
- Statistics for Clinicians
- Machine Learning for City Planners
- R for SAS Programmers


## I Teach Two Classes

1. BIOS 545 Introduction to R Programming 
     + For BIOS students only (for the most part)
     + Ground up introduction to R
     + Fast-paced 
     + Assumes some previous programming
     + Homework Assignments and Final

2. INFO 550 Software Engineering
     + INFO students
     + Assumes previous programming
     + Encourages Exploration
     + Must learn new things rapdily 
     + Project Oriented  
     

# Motivating Learning

## Motivations for Learning ?

- The course is required
- It will be useful for later work
- Someone advised me to take this class
- I couldn't find a more interesting course to take

## (Better) Motivations for Learning ?

- Less reliance upon others
- Enhanced productivity
- Eliminate barriers to research
- Exellent employment prospects

### *You Are Really Teaching Independence*

## Analysis vs Programming Tools 

- R,SAS, SPSS are analysis frameworks first and programming languages second
- Python and Java are programming languages first with analysis addons
- MATLAB is a hybrid


### This doesn't include more specific tools

- Weka
- TensorFlow
- KNIME
- RapidMiner
- Orange
- Pandas 

## At Scale Tools (Increasingly Popular)

- Apache Spark
- TensorFlow
- Big Table
- Redshift
- Apache Mahout
- IoT

Many of these have APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that let you
use your programming language of choice as a primary Interface

# Reproducibility and Availability

## Crisis

<img src="img/repro.png" alt="Drawing" style="width: 700px;"/>


## Use Reproducible Research Tools

- Sweave
- knitr
- Markdown
- Jupyter

## Use Git !!

- Great for Backing Up Your Code 
- Can handle multiple versions
- Can Share with others
- Others can modify and submit changes
- Issue Tracking
- Contains a Wiki


## Learning Analysis and Programming


### Like Learning to Cook

- Start with a good recipe
- Demonstration (by a competent cook)
- Observation (by students)
- Duplication (basic repitition)
- Imitation (repitition with changes)
- Fear of Messing Things Up 

## Just Eat Frozen Food or Eat Out

- Unhealthy
- Little Variation
- Expensive
- No Self Sufficiency
- No Independence

# Creating Interesting Material

## Think of an encompassing project

- For advanced students give them the project all at once

- For Intro classes cover each subtopic per week
      + Homeowork and Labs
      + Maybe a final project
      
- For Intermediate classes do a combination
      + Have mid term and final projects
      + Some supporting homework

## You Gotta Break Things Up

Solving for $\sqrt{S}$ is the same as solving $f(x) = x^2 - S = 0$

We can use Newton's Method to iterate towards an answer:

$$x_{n+1} = x_{n} - \frac{f(x)_n}{f'(x)_n} = x_n - \frac{x_{n}^2 - S}{2x_n} = \frac{1}{2}(x_n + \frac{S}{x_n})$$
Make a first guess and then compute $x_{n+1}$ until $x_{n+1}^2$ is close enough to S within some specified tolerance

## A Beginning Approach

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
Make a guess (e.g 2) of the square root of some number (e.g. 16)
Specify a tolerance level (e.g. 0.0001)

while the absolute value of the square of that guess minus 
      the number  is >= than tolerance
          compute a new guess
```

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
somenum <- 16
tolerance <- 0.0001
guess <- 2

# Note we have to use Absolute value since we 
# are concerned with the magnitude of the difference

while( abs((guess^2)-somenum) >= tolerance) {
  guess <- (guess + (somenum/guess)) * 0.5
}
guess
```

## Segment the work into functions

```{r, eval=FALSE,echo=TRUE}
somenum <- 16
tolerance <- 0.0001
guess <- 2

# Write a Function to judge quality of computed guess 

compare <- function(guess,target) {
   diff <- abs((guess^2)-target)  
   return(diff)
}

while(compare(guess,target) >= tolerance) {
  guess <- (guess + (target/guess)) * 0.5
}

guess
```

## Create functions with sane arguments and defaults

```{r, eval=FALSE,echo=TRUE}
mySqrt <- function(target=16,guess=2,tolerance=0.0001,verbose=FALSE) {
  while( abs((guess^2)-target) >= tolerance) {
    guess <- (guess + (target/guess)) * 0.5
    if (verbose) {
      print(guess)
    }
  }
  return(guess)
}
```

## Functions that embed other functions

```{r, eval=FALSE,echo=TRUE}
mySqrt <- function(target=16,guess=2,tolerance=0.0001,verbose=FALSE) {
  compare <- function(guess,target) {
   diff <- abs((guess^2)-target)  
   return(diff)
  }
  
  while(compare(guess,target) >= tolerance) {
    guess <- (guess + (target/guess)) * 0.5
    if (verbose) {
      print(guess)
    }
  }
  return(guess)
}
mySqrt(16,2,0.0001)
```

## Vectorize the function

```{r eval=FALSE,echo=TRUE}
sapply(c(16,22,49,39),mySqrt)

# or

round(sapply(c(16,22,49,39),mySqrt),2)

# or

Sqrt <- function(input=c(16,22,49,39),rnd=2) {
  retvec <- round(sapply(input,mySqrt),rnd)
  return(retvec)
}

```

# Now for the Dark Side

## Academic Dishonesty

```{r fig.width=6, fig.height=6, echo=FALSE}
library(png)
library(grid)
img <- readPNG("img/mit.png")
grid.raster(img)

```

## Academic Dishonesty

- Lectures on Honor Code Are Helpful
- Keeps the Honest Person Honest
- It Can Still Happen
- Google Is Easy To Use
- Stack Overflow Knowingly Aids and Abets Cheating
- Cheating is Easy to Spot

## Academic Dishonesty

- Competition
- Start the assignment late
- Later assignments rely on earlier work 
- Very easy to get help from others
- Students circulate past assignments
- Claims of language confusion

## Academic Dishonesty

In 2011 this assignment was given in the "Paradigms for Computing'' class at Stanford

```{r fig.width=6, fig.height=4.5, echo=FALSE}
library(png)
library(grid)
img <- readPNG("img/convo2.png")
grid.raster(img)

```


## Academic Dishonesty
Within 1 day this was found on the Stack Overflow site:

```{r fig.width=6, fig.height=5.5, echo=FALSE}
library(png)
library(grid)
img <- readPNG("img/stack.png")
grid.raster(img)

```
